# Dynamical Systems Project
 Project work for the subject Dynamical Systems in which I explore the dynamic behaviors of a memristor-meminductor-based chaotic system, relevant for memory devices and neural networks, by analyzing chaotic, bursting, and quasi-periodic phenomena under different parameters and initial conditions.
